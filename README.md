# Real-time Stock Market Data Engineering Project
This project implements a real-time stock market data engineering pipeline using Apache Kafka and AWS services. The project involves setting up a Kafka producer to simulate real-time data and a Kafka consumer to store the data in an S3 bucket using AWS S3. An AWS Glue crawler is used to extract metadata and AWS Athena query editor is used to query the data.
